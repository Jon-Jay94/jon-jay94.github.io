"Liquidity Facilities: Evidence from High-Frequency Identification" with L. Boneva & S. Weidner. [Paper](https://jonasjensen.eu/files/bcjw_liquidity_facilities.pdf)

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
   This paper constructs a novel high-frequency liquidity news surprise to identify
the effects of Federal Reserve liquidity facility announcements during the Global
Financial Crisis and COVID-19 pandemic. Using local projections, we show that liquidity
facility announcements substantially lower long-term Treasury yields, with
a one percentage point expansionary surprise reducing 10-year yields by approximately
0.2 percentage points. This effect operates almost entirely through term
premia rather than expected future short rates. Inconvenience yields on treasury
securities fall substantially and primary dealer increase their relative holdings of
Treasuries. Our findings demonstrate that liquidity facilities represent an effective
tool which reduce risk premia during financial crises.
