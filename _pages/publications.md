## Working Papers

"The Impact of Monetary Policy and Lender-of-Last-Resort Announcements on the Treasury Market" with L. Boneva & S. Weidner. CEPR Discussion Paper [18426](https://cepr.org/publications/dp18426)

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
   <i>This paper presents new empirical evidence on the behavior of the U.S Treasury market in response to Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) announcements during the Global Financial Crisis and the Covid-19 pandemic. We differentiate between announcements related to policy rate changes and those related to lender-of-last-resort liquidity facilities to examine their distinct impacts on the market. High-frequency data on interest rate futures are used to extract the surprise component of FOMC announcements. To also make use of announcements taking place outside the future exchanges trading hours, we show that high-frequency changes in exchange rates can be used to impute commonly used monetary policy surprises. Our findings reveal that policy rate and liquidity announcements decrease Treasury yields substantially but differ in their transmission mechanism. While announcements related to interest rates primarily affect bond yields through expected lower short rates, lender-of-last-resort announcements decrease bond yields by reducing term premia, demonstrating the complementary role of these different policies in stabilizing the Treasury market by influencing intermediaries and interest rates.</i>

## Work in Progress

"Volume-based Surprises"
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
   <i>
This paper proposes to identify surprises around Federal Open Market Com- mittee (FOMC) announcements based on the abnormal trading trading volume in Eurodollar Futures. The approach identifies announcement-specific window lengths designed to capture convergence trading among market participants. The resulting volume-based window lengths frequently exceed commonly used 30- minute windows.
Volume-based monetary policy surprises suggest that monetary policy has a more pronounced impact on stock prices, term premia, and the economy than previously believed. Notably, volume-based Path surprises elicit responses akin to conventional surprises. These findings underscore the importance of incorpo- rating trading volume dynamics in understanding the effects of monetary policy announcements.</i>
