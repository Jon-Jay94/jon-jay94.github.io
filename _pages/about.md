I'm a Ph.D.-student at the Frankfurt School of Finance & Management. My research interests are in the field of Macrofinance and Monetary Economics, where I study the impact of monetary policy on financial markets. I'm particularly interested in how money markets and fixed income markets update their expectations about future monetary policy actions and how these expectations are priced into asset prices.

In addition, I'm currently teaching a pre-course in Macroeconomics in the MBA program at the Frankfurt School of Finance & Management where I introduce the students the workings of the global economic and financial system. I also taught tutorials in Econometrics & Statistics in the Master of Finance program.

My supervisor is [Prof. Emanuel MÃ¶nch](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=8Cuk5vYAAAAJ&hl=en).
