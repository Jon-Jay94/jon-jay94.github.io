Hi, I'm Jonas Camargos Jensen. I'm a PhD candidate in Financial Economics at the **Frankfurt School of Finance & Management**. 

My research lies in the intersection of **monetary economics and asset pricing**, focusing on how financial markets and central banks interact.

I will be on the academic job market in 2025/2026. My job market paper will be available soon.

## Job Market Paper

{% include paper.html
  title="Trading Volume and Monetary Policy Surprises"
  status="Job Market Paper"
  abstract="High-frequency identification of the causal effects of monetary policy relies on measuring monetary
policy surprisesâ€“changes in interest rate futures prices in narrow windows around FOMC announcements
capturing unexpected shifts in market-based interest rate expectations. Constructing these surprises entails
two key heuristic choices: the event window and the set of interest rate futures contracts. This paper
introduces the Volume-Based Monetary Policy Surprise (VBS), which uses abnormal trading volume to
let the market endogenously determine the relevant event windows, set of futures contracts and their
loadings in the resulting surprise measure for each announcement. The announcement-specific event
windows flexibly capture when prices continue adjusting beyond conventional 30-minute windows and
when relevant information is released during press conferences. The announcement-specific loadings
naturally shift toward longer-dated contracts when the Federal Reserve relies on forward guidance about
future policy. The VBS doubles the estimated impact of monetary policy on Treasury yields and equity
markets and has a sizable impact on macroeconomic aggregates."
