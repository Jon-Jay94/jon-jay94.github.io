I'm a Ph.D.-student at the Frankfurt School of Finance & Management. My research interests are in the field of Macrofinance and Monetary Economics, where I study the impact of monetary policy on financial markets.
In particular, I'm interested in studying if monetary policy decisions have different effects on financial markets in light of post-crisis regulatory reforms, which transformed the way that financial markets work.

In addition, I'm currently teaching a pre-course in Macroeconomics in the MBA program at the Frankfurt School of Finance & Management where I introduce the students the workings of the global economic and financial system. I also teach tutorials in Econometrics & Statistics in the Master of Finance program.

My supervisor is [Prof. Emanuel MÃ¶nch](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=8Cuk5vYAAAAJ&hl=en).
