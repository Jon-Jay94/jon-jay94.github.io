I'm a PhD candidate in Finance at the **Frankfurt School of Finance & Management**, specializing in **Monetary Economics and Asset Pricing**. My research focuses on understanding how monetary policy impacts financial markets, with particular emphasis on how markets update their interest rate expectations around central bank announcements and how these expectations are reflected in asset prices.

I will be on the academic job market in 2025/2026. My job market paper will be available soon.

In addition, I'm currently teaching a pre-course in Macroeconomics in the MBA program at the Frankfurt School of Finance & Management where I introduce the students to the workings of the global economic and financial system. I also taught tutorials in Econometrics & Statistics in the Master of Finance program.

My supervisor is [Prof. Emanuel MÃ¶nch](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=8Cuk5vYAAAAJ&hl=en).
